I am a highly skilled researcher and data scientist with over 7 years of experience in designing, managing, and executing complex research studies. My work spans diverse sectors including public health, gender, digital finance, livelihoods, and road safety, with a strong focus on data-driven insights to inform policy and practice.

I hold a First-Class MSc in Applied Social Data Science from Trinity College Dublin, where I specialised in advanced data analysis, machine learning, and text analytics. My dissertation employed supervised machine learning to analyse public sentiment and hate speech on Reddit, providing insights into the impact of immigration in Ireland.

Over the years, I have led and contributed to research studies funded by prominent organisations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Walmart Foundation, Tata Trusts, Amazon, GiZ, and others. My experience includes conducting impact evaluations, developing mixed-method research designs, and creating actionable reports for high-impact projects across South Asia and Europe.

**Key technical skills:**\
\
**Programming & Analytics:** R, Python, STATA, SPSS, ATLAS.ti, Power BI, LaTeX, Git\
**Machine Learning:** Supervised and unsupervised learning, text analysis, and sentiment analysis\
**Data Visualisation:** Crafting insightful dashboards and reports using Power BI to communicate research findings\
**Research Design:** Expertise in impact evaluations, mixed-methods approaches, and large-scale data frameworks

In my most recent role with the Injuries Resolution Board in Ireland, I developed a comprehensive data framework for vulnerable road users (essentially pedestrians, cyclists and e-scooter/e-bike users) and analysed the multifaceted impacts of road traffic accidents. This work combined rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis to support evidence-based policymaking.

I am passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive societal change and am particularly interested in using advanced analytics and machine learning to address global development challenges. Based in Dublin, I am keen to explore opportunities in research, data science, and policymaking that align with my expertise.
